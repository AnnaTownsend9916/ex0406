I am working on relearning python and have been following a python Course from a professor at the Univeristy of Michigan. This is the python homework assignment working with functions. This is my first python function called computePay. What it does is it checks to see first if the user says they work more than 40 hours, if so there is a math function inside of the statement. Otherwise they recieve normal pay with a different math function. Then I called my function and printed the string and the value of the function being whatever the returned pay amount is.
